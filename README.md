# Six Degrees of Separation (Boxing) 

example:

[Mike Tyson](http://boxrec.com/en/boxer/474) beat [Larry Holmes](http://boxrec.com/en/boxer/150)

[Larry Holmes](http://boxrec.com/en/boxer/150) beat [Muhammad Ali](http://boxrec.com/en/boxer/180)

Mike Tyson and Muhammad Ali never fought, but they have a common opponent.

The purpose of this project is to go beyond weight classes and multiple opponents.
